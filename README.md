## About Me
I am Pavan Kumar Singh, a Data Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Data & AI Engineer at [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com).
- ðŸŒ± Exploring Generative AI (especially applications of Large Language Models), Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His/Him.
- âš¡ Listening to music, binge watching movies and web series, and studying and exploring different technologies are my favourite hobbies.


## Work Experience:

[**American Express**](https://www.americanexpress.com/) | Engineer I (Data & AI) - *March 2024 - Ongoing*
- Building a RAG based Generative AI application leveraging Open AI GPT as well as open-
source LLMs like Llama 2, Langchain and Llama-index for querying different GitHub 
repositories. 
- Building a Generative AI application for querying Tableau dashboards.

[**American Express**](https://www.americanexpress.com/) | Engineer II (Data & AI) - *January 2022 - March 2024*
- Contributed to different Open Source repositories like Keras, HuggingFace etc. as part of American Express Open Source Initiative. 
- Contributed to upgrade multiple Keras official examples to Keras 3 in Keras and Keras-io 
GitHub repository. 
- Identified and solved multiple bugs in existing Keras official examples Keras GitHub 
repository while upgrading to Keras 3. 
- Worked on prediction of number of applications applied daily for each partner using different 
Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Gradient boosting Trees and Time 
Series modelling with hyperparameter tuning using scikit-learn, fb-prophet, Numpy, Pandas, 
Hive and PySpark. 
- Presented different topics related to AI in internal Developer Advocacy events and GuildCon 
2023. 
- Designed different types of architectures for loading data to Jethro like loading data to 
selected partitions, loading data irrespective of partitions, decommissioning Jethro for some 
modules etc. 
- Reduced ETL processing time by 70% while working on the transition of Hive based big data 
legacy system to PySpark. 
- Created a script using Python and PySpark which facilitates the loading of only latest data 
instead of complete data from Hive to Jethro, which results in the reduction of time taken in 
loading data by almost 90% and memory consumption by 80-85%. 
- Created a Python and PySpark script and Event Engine (an internal job scheduling tool) 
node to load data to Jethro from Hive for a given set of partitions on ad-hoc requirements 
which enables developers to load data to Jethro in a single click without manual intervention. 
It supports loading of single month, multiple consecutive months and multiple non-
consecutive months data. 
- Created a Python script as a cross-team collaboration which converts Jethro DDL to 
BigQuery DDL by taking either of Jethro file or Jethro table name and credentials. 
- Perform unit testing and end to end system testing of Hive tables and delimited text files 
using manual testing by running Hive queries and some in-house developed Data Quality 
testing tools.

[**Accenture**](https://www.accenture.com/) | Data Engineering Analyst - *December 2021 - December 2021*
- Worked in a healthcare based multi vendor Big Data project which uses Agile methodology SDLC.
- Worked on Azure Data Factory and SQL.

[**Accenture**](https://www.accenture.com/) | Data Engineering Associate - *September 2019 - November 2021*    
- Worked on Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse and SQL in a healthcare based multi vendor 
Big Data project. 
- Created complex Hive and SQL queries to perform sanity checks of data. 
- Transformed data stored in Hive warehouse by using PySpark SQL. 
- Developed â€˜Test Script Generatorâ€™ using Python which can generate multiple test scripts 
automatically for multiple extracts within few seconds thus reduced time taken in Test Script 
preparation for around 75-90% scenarios by 80%. 
- Prepared Hive queries for generating data by joining multiple tables as per business logic
